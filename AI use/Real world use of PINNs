Q: what are some examples of real world problems we can use PINNs and differential equations for (possibly)

Certainly.
---

Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) combine machine learning with differential equations and are well suited for a wide range of real-world problems where physical laws govern system behavior. These problems typically involve partial or ordinary differential equations and arise across many scientific and engineering disciplines.

One important application area is **heat transfer and diffusion processes**. PINNs can be used to model heat conduction in solids, thermal diffusion in composite materials, and cooling processes in electronics or industrial systems. In many practical situations, material properties such as thermal conductivity may be unknown or spatially varying, making PINNs useful for inferring these parameters while simultaneously solving the governing equations.

In **fluid dynamics**, PINNs are explored for modeling airflow, ocean currents, blood flow, and turbulence. These problems are governed by the Navier–Stokes equations, which are nonlinear and computationally expensive to solve using traditional methods, especially in complex geometries. PINNs offer a mesh-free alternative and can integrate sparse experimental or simulation data with known physical laws.

**Quantum mechanics and quantum chemistry** provide another class of applications. Differential equations such as the Schrödinger equation describe the behavior of quantum systems. PINNs can be used to approximate wavefunctions, solve eigenvalue problems, or assist in quantum control tasks, particularly when analytical solutions are unavailable or the dimensionality is high.

A particularly promising application of PINNs lies in **inverse problems**, where parts of the governing equations or parameters are unknown. Examples include estimating diffusion coefficients, identifying source terms, or reconstructing boundary conditions from limited measurements. Traditional numerical methods often struggle with such problems, whereas PINNs can learn unknown quantities directly from data while enforcing physical constraints.

In **geophysics and earth sciences**, PINNs can be applied to groundwater flow, seismic wave propagation, reservoir modeling, and subsurface transport phenomena. These systems are often characterized by sparse data, uncertain material properties, and large spatial domains, making physics-informed learning approaches attractive.

PINNs are also relevant in **biophysics and medical modeling**, such as tumor growth, drug transport in tissue, cardiac electrophysiology, and blood flow modeling. Biological systems are typically noisy and patient-specific, and PINNs allow physical models to be combined with limited observational data to produce personalized predictions.

In **structural mechanics and materials science**, PINNs can model stress–strain relationships, elastic deformation, crack propagation, and vibration dynamics. These problems are governed by elasticity and wave equations and often involve irregular geometries or complex boundary conditions.

Environmental and climate applications include **pollution dispersion**, atmospheric transport, and ocean temperature modeling. These processes are governed by advection–diffusion equations and benefit from the ability of PINNs to assimilate observational data while preserving physical consistency.

Finally, PINNs have applications in **finance and economics**, where partial differential equations such as the Black–Scholes equation are used for option pricing and risk assessment. PINNs provide an alternative to traditional numerical solvers and Monte Carlo methods, particularly in high-dimensional settings.

Overall, PINNs are most useful in problems governed by differential equations where data are sparse, parameters are uncertain, or traditional grid-based methods become computationally expensive. They are best viewed as a complementary tool to classical numerical methods rather than a universal replacement.
